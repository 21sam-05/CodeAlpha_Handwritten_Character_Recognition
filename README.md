*HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER RECOGNITION*
This repository contains a project for handwritten character recognition implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The aim is to accurately classify individual handwritten characters into their corresponding alphanumeric or symbolic categories.

**Features**
Robust CNN Model: Utilizes a carefully designed CNN architecture for high accuracy in character classification.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes necessary image preprocessing steps (e.g., resizing, normalization, binarization) to prepare handwritten data for the model.

Training & Evaluation Scripts: Provides scripts for training the CNN model and evaluating its performance on a test set.

Inference Capability: Allows for predictions on new, unseen handwritten character images.

Modular Codebase: Organized into clear, maintainable modules for easy understanding and extension.
